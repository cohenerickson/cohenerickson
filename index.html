      About me
    </h1>
    <p>
      I started coding with scratch and soon got into HTML creating simple websites.
      I soon started messing around with embedding flash games in HTML, this progressed to me making my first and what would be my only successful project for a while called Gamesalt.
      Gamesalt was an unblocked games website that I slowly spread to my friends and eventually throughout my entire school at the time.
      After I saw some success with Gamesalt I decided to look more into better CSS practices and learning some JavaScript.
      Using my new skills I made little projects here and there for about a year before I got into NodeJS and Discord bots.
      I then went on to make a Discord bot with a friend called Appeal that has a small user base.
      For the next 2 years I was on and off programmer but not working on any big projects, I would look into some new languages such as python but they would never stick.
      In the beginning of 2022 I learned about a Flash emulator called Ruffle that could emulate all sorts of old flash games.
      I soon got into making another games website called Radon which is now slowly spreading as of writing this.
      Radon currently has about 100 daily users according to google analytics however I believe it to be double this number as some schools such as the one that I go to block the analytics tracking URL.
